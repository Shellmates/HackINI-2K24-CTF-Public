## Description

> I used to work as a network engineer at a prominent company, but I found myself unjustly terminated. The cause? Our network administrator inadvertently shut down a critical interface and then placed the blame on my shoulders to salvage his own reputation.  
> Remarkably, I still retain access to the very panel we once utilized to oversee the network architecture of the company. Now, I seek a talented hacker to exact revenge on my behalf, I am prepared to offer a handsome reward to anyone who could breach this panel's security. Do you possess the expertise and audacity to help me reclaim justice ?"
