description: "> I used to work as a network engineer at a prominent company, but I\
  \ found myself unjustly terminated. The cause? Our network administrator inadvertently\
  \ shut down a critical interface and then placed the blame on my shoulders to salvage\
  \ his own reputation.  \n> Remarkably, I still retain access to the very panel we\
  \ once utilized to oversee the network architecture of the company. Now, I seek\
  \ a talented hacker to exact revenge on my behalf, I am prepared to offer a handsome\
  \ reward to anyone who could breach this panel's security. Do you possess the expertise\
  \ and audacity to help me reclaim justice ?\"  \n   \n\n **Author**: j3x"
