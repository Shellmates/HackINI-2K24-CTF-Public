The poem in the description has some important infomation needed to solve this challenge, we have **2010**, **Algeria**, **Fares** and **forum**. We can use the [Wayback](https://web.archive.org/web/) machine to search for old archived websites using the following keywords منتديات الجزائر   or الجزائر
We will find many results, we need to look for chatting forums that have results in 2010. One of the results is https://web.archive.org/web/20100903213237/http://fares43.ahlamontada.com/, in that forum we can find someone sending messages with a username **fares_XPS**.  
The second part of this challenge is to reach to this person now, we can think of searching for social media accounts with that username. We can use online tools like [idcrawl](https://www.idcrawl.com/) or other tools like sherlock.  
We will find a twitter account with that username and the flag in the bio.  

- the flag is: shellmates{th4Nk$_F0R_USinG_OsINT}
