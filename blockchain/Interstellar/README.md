## Description

> Our ShellX astronauts has ventured into the great unknown. Regrettably, space swallowed their signal, leaving us with nothing but a singular lifeline, a smart contract designed to push their ship further in the galactical realm, but all it does now is plunges them deeper into the cosmic void.
> Perhaps, guiding them to the black hole that we once tried our best to avoid, could potentially transport them back to the planet, it is as it's said: a gateway within the depths of universe.
