description: "> Our ShellX astronauts has ventured into the great unknown. Regrettably,\
  \ space swallowed their signal, leaving us with nothing but a singular lifeline,\
  \ a smart contract designed to push their ship further in the galactical realm,\
  \ but all it does now is plunges them deeper into the cosmic void.\n> Perhaps, guiding\
  \ them to the black hole that we once tried our best to avoid, could potentially\
  \ transport them back to the planet, it is as it's said: a gateway within the depths\
  \ of universe.\n> challenge page : challenge page: [http://blockchain1.shellmates.club/interstellar/](http://blockchain1.shellmates.club/interstellar/)\n\
