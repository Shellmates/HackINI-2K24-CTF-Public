# Prayvate Vault

**`Author:`** [j3x]()

## Description

> Traditional banks are really outdated, who still relies on physical vaults and trusts the anonymous people that are in control with his money in 2024 ? Not me. I'm smart, so I designed a smart contract as a digital vault for my funds on Ethereum, a decentralized world so I don't have to worry about theft and manipulation.
