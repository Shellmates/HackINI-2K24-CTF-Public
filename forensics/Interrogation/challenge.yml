description: "> In the latest case of Sherlock, a breach at the London Tower was executed\
  \ with just a few lines of code. The perpetrator, the famous criminal consultant\
  \ Moriarty, has been arrested. However, despite hours of interrogation, Moriarty\
  \ has remained tight-lipped about both the software he used and the group he represents.\
  \ As a result, our IT experts have turned their attention to his laptop. But Sherlock\
  \ has warned us that Moriarty may have an anti-forensics laptop that adds an additional\
  \ layer of complexity. By taking a look at his machine, Can you figure out the tool\
  \ he used, the group he's affiliated with and the server used for coordination?\
