description: "> During a recent operation, I managed to exfiltrate a Wi-Fi password\
  \ from a network by exploiting a vulnerability in an exposed webserver hosted on\
  \ the target system.So I tried  to capture the over-the-air traffic of that network\
  \ .  Unfortunately, the network capture got corrupted. Your task is to assist in\
  \ recovering the corrupted file and leveraging the exfiltrated password to decrypt\
  \ the traffic. Unravel the mystery within the compromised network traffic.\n   \n\
