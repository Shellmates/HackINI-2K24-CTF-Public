## Description

> During a recent operation, I managed to exfiltrate a Wi-Fi password from a network by exploiting a vulnerability in an exposed webserver hosted on the target system.So I tried  to capture the over-the-air traffic of that network .  Unfortunately, the network capture got corrupted. Your task is to assist in recovering the corrupted file and leveraging the exfiltrated password to decrypt the traffic. Unravel the mystery within the compromised network traffic.
